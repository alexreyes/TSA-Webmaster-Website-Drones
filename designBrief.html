2017 Design Brief
Augmented Reality: Understanding the Potential Benefits and Challenges
Context
Augmented reality technologies have the potential to change from merely being applied
in gaming environments to becoming applications across a wide variety of
environments. From potential uses to concerns about safety and privacy, topics about
augmented reality are featured daily in the news and are trending on social media.
Augmented realities have the possibility of affecting countless lives — both positively
and negatively.
Challenge
Design an information website that presents an overview of the uses, technologies,
benefits, and concerns of augmented reality.
For the purpose of this project, teams should focus their solution on the existing AND
potential future commercial, educational, recreational, and research uses for augmented
reality technology. Sections of the website that is created should focus on the current
available technologies, safety concerns, and potential future uses.
Evaluation
Thought should be given to effective website design practices and cross‐platform
compatibility. The website will be evaluated using any combination of Windows 7/8/10,
as well as Mac OS X, in any browser supported by those platforms, including the latest
versions of Internet Explorer, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Mobile browsers MAY
be used in evaluation. Teams should strive to create a clean, easy‐to‐use website that
features an excellent presentation of the required content.
Submission Procedure
For NATIONAL COMPETITION: Teams must submit their URL to
webentry@tsaweb.org no later than 11:59 pm PDT on May 15, 2017.
For STATE COMPETITION: Teams should consult their state website for details about
submission procedures for their state conference.</p>
